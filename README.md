# 🧑‍💼 Employee ID Generator & Data Simulation

This project generates synthetic employee IDs and simulates employee-related datasets using Python. Ideal for testing HR analytics systems, mock dashboards, and training ML models without real data.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔢 **Unique ID Generator** using `numpy` randomization  
- 🧪 **Test Data Simulation** for employee roles, IDs, departments  
- 📦 **Export-ready DataFrames** using `pandas`  
- ⚡ Lightweight and customizable  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3**  
- **NumPy** – for deterministic random data  
- **Pandas** – for tabular manipulation  

## 📂 File Structure

```
Employee_ID.ipynb   # Notebook with complete logic
```

## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open `Employee_ID.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells to generate employee data  

## 🧠 Use Case

- HR analytics demo
