# Employee ID Generator & Data Simulation

This project generates synthetic employee IDs and simulates employee-related datasets using Python. Ideal for testing HR analytics systems, mock dashboards, and training ML models without real data.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

-  **Unique ID Generator** using `numpy` randomization  
-  **Test Data Simulation** for employee roles, IDs, departments  
-  **Export-ready DataFrames** using `pandas`  
-  Lightweight and customizable  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Python 3**  
- **NumPy** â€“ for deterministic random data  
- **Pandas** â€“ for tabular manipulation  

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

```
Employee_ID.ipynb   # Notebook with complete logic
```

## âœ… How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open `Employee_ID.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells to generate employee data  

## Use Case

- HR analytics demo  
- Sample data for testing dashboards or ML models  
- Education and training for data manipulation
